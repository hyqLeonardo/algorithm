Now you can thank Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice for making Captain America: Civil War happen.

Warner Bros. originally had Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice set for the same release date as Captain America: Civil War. During that time, Marvel Studios didn’t reveal the name of the third Captain America film. However, Warner Bros. decided to back off and changed the date for a March 25th release. The end result is that both movies will have some breathing room.

After the Russo brothers were done with Captain America: The Winter Soldier and it became a huge success with critics, fans and at the box office, they had to go back into the drawing room to come up with something that would blow people’s minds. With Batman v Superman coming out in the same year, it helped turn the third Captain America movie into Captain America: Civil War, as revealed by director Joe Russo in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.

“For our part, when we finished Winter Soldier two years ago and we were thinking about doing the next one,” said Russo. “The only thing that seemed interesting to us was to deconstruct the Marvel Universe — because where else can we go at this point? There have been 11 or 12 movies so far, all with a fairly traditional structure. Our pitch to them was: People will tell you they love chocolate ice cream — until you give it to them five days a week. It’s time to give them some rainbow sherbet. Kevin [Feige] is a maverick and he’s very sensitive to how people are responding to his content. He said he thought we might be right. And after they announced Batman v. Superman, he said, ‘you guys are absolutely right.’ We needed to do something challenging with the material or we were going to start to lose the audience.”

Captain America: Civil War hits theaters on May 6, 2016.
